### Hi, my name is Thaís Rozas!

## About Me:
📌 I'm a junior Frontend Developer with a background in Sociology of Science and Technology. <br> 🦉 As a sociologist, I have developed a keen eye for analyzing social systems and its relationship with scientific and technological developments. My experience with sociological researches and other projects has also helped me to develop a critical perspective on the world around me. <br> 🚀 As a developer, it's easy to get caught up in the details of code and lose sight of the bigger picture. However, my sociological training has taught me to always consider the context of a problem and to question assumptions and biases that might be influencing my thinking. This has helped me to approach programming challenges with a more open mind and to be more creative and innovative in my solutions. I believe that this approach has made me a more effective and empathetic developer. <br> 👩‍💻 In frontend development, I have work experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I'm always eager to learn more. I'm particularly interested in web development and I'm currently expanding my knowledge in web frameworks, such as React, and technologies for backend development like Node.js and PHP. <br> 💻 I'm currently working for a university as the programmer responsible for the use and customization of its Learning Management System (LMS). <br> 😎 In my spare time, I enjoy reading about the latest developments in technology and sociology, and also different genres of fiction, playing tennis and beach tennis and surfing in different spots at Fortaleza, Ceará. Let's connect and collaborate on a project that makes a difference!
